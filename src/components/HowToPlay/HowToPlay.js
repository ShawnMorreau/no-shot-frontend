    Welcome to my game! No Shot!, a card game in which you create 
    amazing scenarios for another person to sabotage! Each round 
    a player will be chosen as a Judge and in a counter-clockwise order
    each player will lay down two OP cards to create an amazing scenario for 
    this judge. You will then be able to sabotage the player to your lefts scenario, 
    in hopes that the judge will pick your scenario.<br/><br/>

    The game is in early stages so there is still a lot of work to do to make it look like 
    a solid finalized game, although, from my testing it is fully functional. On 
    that note you may encounter bugs. If you'd like, you can take a screenshot and describe the bug 
    and I will gladly investigate it. <b> shawn.morreau@gmail.com </b>

    Ideally, there will be lobbys and private codes that you can send to your friends but I just wanted
    to get something up and running initially and worry about after I have all the initial logic setup. 

    Thanks and Enjoy!
